# Mylyn development #

To have a look at what it is like to develop a [Mylyn](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn) integration, install [Mylyn extras](http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/extras) and [Mylyn incubator](http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/incubator) via normal plugin installation in Eclipse.

If you experience problems due to unsolved dependencies, make sure update site "Mylyn for Eclipse 3.4 and 3.5" is enabled (which often seems to be disabled per default).

[Here](http://blog.bielu.com/2010/03/creating-mylyn-connector-plugin-part-1.html) is a great tutorial on how to set up you environment and to get started.

IBM has written something two articles about Mylyn 2.0. It is an old version but parts of it might still be valuable.

# Misc #

If you are using Google code for issue management (not Pivotal Tracker), it is still possible to [integrate in Eclipse via Mylyn](http://www.jroller.com/alexRuiz/entry/using_mylyn_with_google_code).
