# Running pt-eclipse #

There is currently no Eclipse update site available for pt-eclipse. For now you need to follow these steps in order to use pt-eclipse:

  1. Check out the source code
  1. Import the two projects (core and ui) in Eclipse via "File/Import.../Existing Projects into Workspace".
  1. [Run the plugin as an Eclipse application](http://pt-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/run_as_eclipse_application.png).
  1. A new Eclipse window should pop up. Bring up the "Task Repositories" view (Window/Show View), right click in the wiew and select "Add Task Repository". Then it should look like [this](http://pt-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/add_task_repo.png).

# CI server #

There is a Hudson project at [webbservern.se](http://webbservern.se:8090/) for pt-eclipse. There is still some configuration to be done in this area. Do not hesitate to tell me if you want an account for this Hudson installation.
