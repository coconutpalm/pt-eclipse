#summary How to run and build pt-eclipse

= Running pt-eclipse =

There is currently no Eclipse update site available for pt-eclipse. For now you need to follow these steps in order to use pt-eclipse:

 # Check out the source code
 # Import the two projects (core and ui) as "existing Eclipse projects".
 # [http://pt-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/run_as_eclipse_application.png Run the plugin as an Eclipse application].
 # A new Eclipse window should pop up. Bring up the "Task Repositories" view (Window/Show View), right click in the wiew and select "Add Task Repository". Then it should look like [http://pt-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/add_task_repo.png this].

= CI server =

There is a Hudson project at [http://webbservern.se:8090/ webbservern.se] for pt-eclipse. There is still some configuration to be done in this area. Do not hesitate to tell me if you want an account for this Hudson installation.
